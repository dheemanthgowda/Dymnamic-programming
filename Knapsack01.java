 * Knapsack 0/1
 * Problem statement:
 * Given weights and prices of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total prices
 * in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays prices[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent prices and
 * weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,find
 * out the maximum prices subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 *
 * The problem statement above can be solved using recursive approach. But the time complexity would be O(2^items).
 * The top-down tabular approach(DP) bring down the complexity to O(items*maxWeightCapacity) because redundant calculations of states are
 * avoided.
